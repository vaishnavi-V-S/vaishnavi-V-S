### Backend Engineering · Java Full Stack · Data-Aware Systems

Java Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building backend-driven applications using **Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL**.  
I enjoy writing clean backend logic, working with data, and building systems that are reliable, readable, and scalable.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do
- Design backend systems using Java & Spring Boot
- Build RESTful APIs and integrate databases
- Implement authentication, authorization, and CRUD workflows
- Work across backend layers: data → services → APIs
- Learn by building real projects, not just tutorials
